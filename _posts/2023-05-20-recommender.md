<p align="center" style="font-size: 14px; width: 80%; margin: auto;">
We are developing an efficient parallel distributed algorithm for matrix completion, based on an existing system called, NOMAD (Non-locking, stOchastic Multi-machine algorithm for Asynchronous and Decentralized matrix completion). 
Our system is a decentralized algorithm which optimize the communication between processors.
