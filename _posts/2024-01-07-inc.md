Traditional data networks passively transport data from one node to another and the role of computation within such networks is extremely limited. The discussion on computation in the network devices have existed since 1996 through the active networks architecture and Open Signalling communities. Active Networks allowed the network to perform customized computations on the user data. Open Signalling was a series of workshops entitled with the goal of making ATM, Internet and mobile networks more open, extensible and programmable. Although such discussion existed for a long time, the real hardware to run computation in the network devices were not available. Recently, Programmable Network devices (PNDs) such as SmartNICs and programmable switches allows to run customized computation on the network devices. Nowadays, <a href="https://www.dolphinics.no/index.html">In-network computing (INC)</a>, also known as In-network computation or Netcompute, refers to the execution of customized programs within such PNDs.
