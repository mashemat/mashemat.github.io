<strong>Communication systems</strong> play a critical role in connecting the distributed components of AI, enabling them to work together seamlessly. At the same time, <strong>AI enhances communication networks</strong> by making them more adaptive, intelligent, and efficient. This two-way interaction introduces important challenges and opportunities, as researchers and engineers explore how AI and networks can best support and strengthen one another.

To explore this space, <strong>COM4AI</strong> is launching a series of talks focused on the <strong>synergy between artificial intelligence and communication networks</strong>—how they co-evolve, influence each other, and create new opportunities and challenges. We expand the notion of communication to examine how AI systems communicate <em>internally</em>, <em>with humans</em>, <em>with other machines</em>, and <em>across networks</em>.

<br/>

<p align="center" style="font-size: 15px; max-width: 800px; margin: auto; line-height: 1.7;">
We bring together <strong>researchers</strong>, <strong>engineers</strong>, and <strong>enthusiasts</strong> to discuss the future of communication technologies and AI systems.
