Communication systems play a critical role in connecting the distributed components of AI, enabling them to work together seamlessly. At the same time, AI enhances communication networks by making them more adaptive, intelligent, and efficient. This two-way interaction introduces important challenges and opportunities, as researchers and engineers explore how AI and networks can best support and strengthen one another.

To explore this space, COM4AI is launching a series of talks focused on the synergy between artificial intelligence and communication networks—how they co-evolve, influence each other, and create new opportunities and challenges. In particular, we will expand the notion of communication to examine how AI systems communicate internally, with humans, with other machines, and across networks.

We bring together researchers, engineers, and enthusiasts to discuss the future of communication technologies and AI systems. Please join us as we discover the future of communication and AI together.

You can follow our 📅 events on the COM4AI <a href="https://www.meetup.com/com4ai/">Meetup page</a>, and if you miss a session, all talks are recorded and published on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@com4ai">COM4AI ▶️  YouTube channel</a>. We look forward to seeing you at our events!
