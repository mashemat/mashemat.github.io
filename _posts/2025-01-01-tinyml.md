Deploying machine learning on resource constrained devices such as microcontrollers,
especially in remote environments presents significant challenges. We explores solving these challenges in the framework of TinyMLOps, focusing on enabling live model updates and predicting inference latency on STM microcontrollers.

To address these challenges, I explored its integration into in-memory storage systems, evaluating how RDMA can accelerate data access, minimize overhead, and enhance scalability. This research underscored the need for precise memory management and network optimization to fully harness RDMA for effective in-memory storage solutions.

You can read the fundamentals of RDMA communication in our paper  <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/8/11/2034">Communicating Efficiently on Cluster-Based Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) over InfiniBand Protocol</a>. You can also read more about RDMA performancee challenges and how it can be used in in-memory storage in our paper <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9119827">Analyzing in-memory nosql landscape</a>.
