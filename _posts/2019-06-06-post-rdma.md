Describe the RDMA communication.


In my research, I focused on Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) interconnects. I concentrated on identifying critical bottlenecks and limitations that impact its efficiency in high-performance computing environments. RDMA facilitates direct memory access between nodes without CPU involvement, providing low-latency and high-throughput communication. However, factors such as network congestion, hardware constraints, and unoptimized software stacks can limit its full potential. To address these challenges, I explored its integration into in-memory storage systems, evaluating how RDMA can accelerate data access, minimize overhead, and enhance scalability. This research underscored the need for precise memory management and network optimization to fully harness RDMA for effective in-memory storage solutions.
