Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) is a high-speed interface standard used to connect various hardware components within a computer system which facilitates communication between the CPU and peripheral devices such as graphics cards, storage drives, network cards, and other expansion cards. However, this protocol  can be used to connect multiple computers and IO systems together to create high performance computing platforms. PCIe network provide significant improvements in response time and transaction throughput compared to using alternative interconnect technologies. <a href="https://www.dolphinics.no/index.html">Dolphin Interconnect</a> is one of the examples of PCIe network. As can be seen PCIe network has less protocols conversion on the data path comparing to the RDMA communication. We are evaluating and exploring the use cases of the PCIe network in data services.
