Traditional power grids generally carry power from a few central generators to a large number of users or customers. A Smart Grid represents a transformative evolution in the
way electricity is generated, transmitted, distributed, and consumed. Unlike traditional power grids, a Smart Grid leverages cutting-edge technologies to enhance efficiency, reliability, and sustainability across the entire energy ecosystem. From these distributed energy resources emerged a new form of energy trading mechanism known as Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading.

We review the characteristics of bot traffic in real-world e-commerce websites and analyze how these characteristics can bring vulnerability while using in-network caching in the backend. We outline how the presence of bot traffic can lead to higher cache misses of legitimate users. As depicted, regular users typically request popular items, leading to the storage of these items within the in-network caching system. However, malicious bots follow a different pattern, actively soliciting less popular items and attempting to inject counterfeit popular items into the caching system. The introduction of this injection results in the removal of popular accessed items, leading to a notable rise in data access latency for normal clients.

In this work, we propose  <a href="https://eng.ox.ac.uk/media/zwgjgmef/hemmatpour2024incs.pdf">In-network Caching Shelter (INCS)</a>, a mitigation solution for attacks on in-network caching. To safeguard the caching system, an in-network machine learning framework (i.e., Planter) is used to classify incoming requests, detecting and acting on bot-generated queries. INCS runs on a programmable network target, such as a Data Processing Unit (DPU) or SmartNIC using Behavioral Model Version 2 (BMV2) or Open vSwitch (OvS).
