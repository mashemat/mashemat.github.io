## 1. **Power-efficient intelligent in-network framework}{ (European Unionâ€™s Horizon MISO project - University of Tromso)**
**Description**:  
The goal of MISO project is to develop and demonstrate an autonomous in-situ observation platform for use in hard-to-reach areas. I develop an intelligent framework to reduce the power consumption of end nodes. Moreover, I develop an in-network intelligent solution to detect anomalies of IoT nodes.
