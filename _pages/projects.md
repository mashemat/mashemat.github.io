##### 1. **Power-efficient intelligent framework (European Union’s Horizon MISO project - University of Tromso)**
<small>The goal of MISO project is to develop and demonstrate an autonomous in-situ observation platform for use in hard-to-reach areas. We are developing an intelligent framework to reduce the power consumption of end nodes. Moreover, We are developing an in-network intelligent solution to detect anomalies of IoT nodes.</small>

##### 2. **In-network computing (Simula Research Laboratory)**
<small>The goal of this project was exploring the in-network computing research directions. We have worked on several programmable network devices including FPGA and Soc based SmartNIC as well as programmable switch. Currently, I am supervising several master thesis on this field. Here are some of our published studies:</small>

##### 3. **Network management (Linux Foundation Collaborative Project in Cisco Systems)**

<small>In this project, we designed and implemented a Yet Another Next Generation (YANG) model to enable VPP to communicate with remote controllers such as OpenDaylight (ODL) and Network Services Orchestrator (NSO) in order to receive telemetry and push configuration. This project enables VPP to communicate with a network routing software suite such as FRRouting (FRR).</small>

##### 4. **Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) (Research project Politecnico di Torino & T.J. Watson IBM research center)**
<small>The goal of this project was investigating performance challenges of RDMA operations in InfiniBand based clusters. Then,
we designined and implemented an RDMA enabled in-memory key-value store.</small>

##### 5. **Health care system (OPportunities for active and healthy LONgevity (OPLON) project)**
<small>The goal of this project was designing and implementing a holistic approach to detect an abnormal gait in order to avoid an unintentional fall and in case of a fall detection reduces injuries and notifies care givers.</small>

##### 6. **Fault injection (Research Project Politecnico di Torino & University of Montpellier)**
<small>The goal of this project was designing and implementing a framework to automatically inject faults into a real-time operating system (i.e., FreeRTOS) for specific hardware (i.e., STM32 Discovery boards).</small>

##### 7. **Linux kernel scheduler optimization (Research Project at Politecnico di Torino)**
<small>In this project we were introducing new parameter (i.e., the number of data cache misses) at the given time slice to the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) scheduler. In this way, the scheduler can penalizes processes which waste CPU cycles to handle cache miss instead of the main task.</small>


- [Report](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/383057404_Change_scheduling_priority_according_to_cache_miss_rate)  


##### 8. **Synchronization on  (Research project Politecnico di Torino & École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL))**
<small>The goal of this project was exploiting hardware message passing feature in system-on-a-chip CPU (i.e., TILE-Gx36) in order to enhance the performnce of the non-blocking synchronization algorithm.</small>
