I am Masoud Hemmatpour, a researcher in computer science. I received the M.S. degree in Computer and Communication Network Engineering and the Ph.D. degree in Control and Computer Engineering both from [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/), Italy, in 2015, and 2019, respectively. Currently, I am research associate  in [Arctic University of Norway (UiT)](https://uit.no/startsida). My research interests focus on High Performance Computing (HPC) interconnect, particularly in the areas of concurrent programming and dynamic memory management in parallel and distributed systems. 

I am deeply interested in exploring research institutes worldwide, as I believe that visiting different institutes will not only broaden my perspective on academic opportunities but also immerse me in diverse cultures and environments. I have had the opportunity to visit several institutes, including École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Purdue University, University of California Davis, Stanford, ETH Zurich, Berkeley, UCLA, and Oxford.
