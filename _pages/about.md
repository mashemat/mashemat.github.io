I am **Masoud Hemmatpour**, a researcher/engineer in computer science. I received my **M.S. degree in Computer and Communication Network Engineering** and my **Ph.D. degree in Control and Computer Engineering** from the [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/), Italy, in **2015** and **2019**, respectively.

My research focuses on **integrating artificial intelligence into hardware systems**, including **programmable network devices** and **resource-constrained (tiny) devices**. I leverage emerging hardware technologies to **optimize memory access**, **improve performance**, and **enhance energy efficiency**, with the goal of enabling intelligent systems across the computing continuum—from cloud and network infrastructures to edge and low-power devices. You can find my full CV [here](/assets/resume.pdf).

I am strongly motivated by **international research collaboration** and continuously seek opportunities to engage with research institutes worldwide. Visiting different institutes allows me to broaden my academic perspective while gaining exposure to diverse cultures and research environments. I have had the opportunity to visit and collaborate with several institutions, including **École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)**, **Purdue University**, **University of California, Davis**, **Stanford University**, **ETH Zurich**, **UC Berkeley**, **UCLA**, and **Oxford University**.

Beyond research, one of my greatest passions is **traveling**. Exploring new places allows me to connect with diverse cultures and gain insights into different traditions and ways of thinking. Each journey broadens my horizons and deepens my appreciation for global diversity. You can follow my travels and adventures on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/travel_world_wide_wise/) page, where I share photos and stories from around the world.
