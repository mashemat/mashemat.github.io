I am Masoud Hemmatpour, a researcher in computer science. I received the M.S. degree in Computer and Communication Network Engineering and the Ph.D. degree in Control and Computer Engineering both from [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/), Italy, in 2015, and 2019, respectively. Currently, I am research associate  in [Arctic University of Norway (UiT)](https://uit.no/startsida). My research interests focus on High Performance Computing (HPC) interconnect, particularly in the areas of concurrent programming and dynamic memory management in parallel and distributed systems. You can find my full CV [here](/assets/resume.pdf).

I am deeply interested in exploring research institutes worldwide, as I believe that visiting different institutes will not only broaden my perspective on academic opportunities but also immerse me in diverse cultures and environments. I have had the opportunity to visit several institutes, including École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Purdue University, University of California Davis, Stanford, ETH Zurich, Berkeley, UCLA, and Oxford.

One of my greatest passions is traveling, as it allows me to engage with diverse cultures and learn from the unique traditions and perspectives of people around the world. Each journey is an opportunity to expand my horizons and gain a deeper understanding of global diversity.
