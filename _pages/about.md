I am Masoud Hemmatpour, I am researcher at [Arctic University of Norway (UiT)](https://en.uit.no/ansatte/person?p_document_id=809882). I received the M.S. degree in Computer and Communication Network Engineering and the Ph.D. degree in Control and Computer Engineering both from [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/), Italy, in 2015, and 2019, respectively. Furthermore, I investigated control and management plane in cloud-native environment in Cisco System. Currently, I am investigating energy efficient in-network machinelLearning in UiT and [Simula Research Laboratory](https://www.simula.no/).

 I am very interested in exploring universities around the world. I believe that visiting different campuses will not only provide me with a broader perspective on academic opportunities but also allow me to experience diverse cultures and environments. I visited different highly ranked schools such as École Politechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Purdue University, and University of California Davis, Stanford, ETH, Berkeley, and UCLA. My research interest includes In-network computing, High Performance Computing (HPC) in the context of concurrent programming and dynamic memory management in parallel and distributed systems utilizing modern hardware, such as hardware message passing and Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA). Moreover, I have interest on healthcare systems and biology
