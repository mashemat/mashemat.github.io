I am Masoud Hemmatpour, a researcher in computer science. I received the M.S. degree in Computer and Communication Network Engineering and the Ph.D. degree in Control and Computer Engineering both from [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/), Italy, in 2015, and 2019, respectively. Currently, I am research associate  in [Arctic University of Norway (UiT)](https://uit.no/startsida). I am Masoud Hemmatpour, a computer science researcher specializing in system research and high-performance computing (HPC) interconnects. My recent work focuses on integrating AI into various hardware platforms, including programmable network devices and tiny devices. I leverage emerging hardware technologies in my research to optimize memory access, enhance performance, and improve energy efficiency. You can find my full CV [here](/assets/resume.pdf).

I am deeply interested in exploring research institutes worldwide, as I believe that visiting different institutes will not only broaden my perspective on academic opportunities but also immerse me in diverse cultures and environments. I have had the opportunity to visit several institutes, including École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Purdue University, University of California Davis, Stanford, ETH Zurich, Berkeley, UCLA, and Oxford.

Apart from my research, one of my biggest passions is traveling. Exploring new places allows me to connect with diverse cultures and gain insights into the unique traditions and perspectives of people worldwide. Each trip is a chance to broaden my horizons and deepen my appreciation for global diversity.
