Below is a list of my teaching experiences and invited talks.

## Teaching

### 1. **System Programming**  
   - **Institution**: Politecnico di Torino 
   - **Role**: Teaching assistant  
   - **Year**: 3 Academic Years (2017,2018,2019) 
   - **Description**: This course describes the programming interfaces for system programming and resource management and concurrent programming. It introduces system programming techniques within Unix-based operating system. I was responsible for the labs and final exam. You can access to the material of the course [here.](https://github.com/mashemat/Courses/tree/master/System%20Programming)

### 2. **Operating System**  
   - **Institution**: Politecnico di Torino 
   - **Role**: Teaching assistant  
   - **Year**: 2 Academic Years (2017,2018) 
   - **Description**: The course provides an overview of operating system (OS) architecture and its associated development frameworks,
focusing on Unix-based operating systems. This involves examining the internal structure of the OS concerning the
underlying hardware. I was responsible for the labs and final exam. You can access to the material of the course [here.](https://github.com/mashemat/Courses/tree/master/Operating%20System)

### 1. **Linux fundamentals and network services**  
   - **Institution**: Fanavaran Pasargad J 
   - **Role**: Teacher  
   - **Year**: 3 Years (2010,2011,2012) 
   - **Description**: I have taught over **1000 hours** Linux Fundamentals and Network Services in several universities and companies, covering topics such as system administration, command-line proficiency, shell scripting, network configuration, and troubleshooting. My sessions have provided students with a solid foundation in Linux environments and essential networking concepts, preparing them for real-world IT and system administration roles. I followed Linux Professional Institute (LPI) syllabus. You can access to the LPI levels [here.](https://www.lpi.org/our-certifications/summary-of-lpi-certifications/)

## Talks

## 1. **From Data Networks to Intelligent Networks: In-Network Computingâ€™s Promise**   
   - **Location**: Paris, France  
   - **Event**: Laboratory of Information, Networking and Communication Sciences (LINCS)  
   - **Description**: In this talk, I reviewed the hardware and software technologies accessible for in-network computing. Moreover, I outlined the obstacles encountered in in-network computing and delved into the opportunities that this technology presents. Additionally, I explored a selection of applications that leverage in-network.

I have actively organized many talks and seminars at our institute, bringing in experts from various fields to share their insights on cutting-edge topics. Here are a selection of talks organize by me:

## 1. **Toward Distributed In-Network Machine Learning**   
   - **Location**: Tromso, Norway
   - **Speaker**:  Changgang Zheng, Engineering Science at the University of Oxford  
   - **Description**: Deploying in-network machine learning applications in programmable network devices faces challenges in scalability due to resource constraints. This presentation introduces DINC, a distributed deployment framework used to scale in-network computing models.
