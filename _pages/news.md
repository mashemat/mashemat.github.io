You can find all available, ongoing, and completed theses and internships. Feel free to contact me if you're interested in any of the topics.

## Available thesis/internship

### 1. **In-network Acceleration of Big Data Processing**   
   - **Description**: In this thesis, we are investigating SmartNIC which is equipped with an Arm processor
      to enhance the performance of Bigdata processing/accessing.
   - **Location**: University of Oslo (UiO)
   - [Link](https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/studier/masteroppgaver/nd/in-network-acceleration-of-big-data-processing.html)

### 2. **Speeding up distributed matrix completion**   
   - **Description**: In this thesis, the candidate is expected to improve existing recomender system in two aspects: (1) a better division of work that can lead to a higher ratio of computation versus data communication (the higher the better for the computing speed); (2) an improved parallel implementation that avoids blindly passing data to a random processor.
