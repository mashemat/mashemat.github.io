### 1. *[GridWatch: A Smart network for Smart Grid [SmartGridComm2024]](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:cae1d460-3da1-4a5e-940e-05eb147a061c/files/svx021g97w)*
Decentralized energy transactions within untrusted and non-transparent energy markets in modern smart grids expose vulnerabilities and are susceptible to attacks. To address this threat, this paper proposes GridWatch, an effective real-time in-network intelligent framework to detect false data injection attacks.

### 2. **[E-commerce bot traffic: In-network impact, detection, and mitigation[ICIN2024]](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/media/zwgjgmef/hemmatpour2024incs.pdf)**
This explores a vulnerability of in-network caching to bots traffic, showing it can significantly degrade performance. To mitigate the effect of bots traffic it introduces In-network Caching Shelter (INCS), an in-network machine learning solution implemented on NVIDIA BlueField-2 DPU.

### 3. **[ In-network monitoring strategies for HPC cloud[AINA2024]](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-57942-4_35)**
Network monitoring process can introduce additional
over-head and consume system resources, potentially impacting the
overall performance of HPC applications. This paper investigates dif-
ferent strategies to enable a low-overhead monitoring system utilizing
emerging programmable network devices.

### 4. **[Operationalizing AI in Future Networks: A Birdâ€™s Eye View from the System Perspective[IEEE Communications Magazine]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.04073)**
This article concentrates on the practical issues of de-
veloping and operating ML-based solutions in real networks. More-
over, it enumerates the key factors hindering the integration of AI/ML
in real networks and review existing solutions to uncover the missing
considerations.

### 5. **[Analyzing In-memory NoSQL Landscape [IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering2020]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9119827)**
This paper describes a break-down analysis of the state-
of-the-art of the RDMA-based in-memory NoSQL systems regard-
ing the indexing, data consistency, and the communication proto-
col. In addition, It compares traditional in-memory NoSQL with their
RDMA-enabled counterparts.

### 6. **[Communicating Efficiently on Cluster-Based Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) over InfiniBand Protocol[MDPI Applied Science 2018]](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/8/11/2034)**
This paper evaluates communication paradigms in ex-
isting systems and new possible paradigms. Moreover, it analyzes the
advantages and drawbacks of each paradigm. To further expand the
investigation, the proposed communication paradigm is substituted in
a real-world distributed application and evaluates the performance.

### 7. **[Kanzi: A distributed, in-memory key-value store [ACM Middleware2016]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3007592.3007594)**
This paper introduces Kanzi, a distributed, in-memory
key-value stored over shared-memory architecture enabled by remote
direct memory access (RDMA) technology.

### 8. **[Cost Evaluation of Synchronization Algorithms for Multicore Architectures [ChapterBook]](https://www.igi-global.com/chapter/cost-evaluation-of-synchronization-algorithms-for-multicore-architectures/214654)**
The first contribution of this study is to evaluate the
costs of the synchronization techniques such as such as Ticket lock,
Filter lock, Readers-writer lock, and Read-Copy Update (RCU) ac-
cording to memory access, system call, and spinning. The second
contribution of this study is the analysis of both hardware and soft-
ware solutions to reduce the synchronization costs.

### 9. **[DIIG: a distributed industrial IoT gateway [IEEE COMPSAC2017]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8029694)**
This work describes the development of a distributed industrial IoT gateway, called DIIG, able to relay industrial network data to a centralized data store.

### 10. **[Polynomial classification model for real-time fall prediction system [IEEE COMPSAC2017]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8029725)**
This paper presents an algorithm with polynomial clas-
sification model of human gait for real-time fall prediction. This ap-
proach enables the user to detect the transition from a normal to an
abnormal walking pattern.
