### 1. **[GridWatch: A Smart network for Smart Grid [SmartGridComm2024]](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:cae1d460-3da1-4a5e-940e-05eb147a061c/files/svx021g97w)**
   - Abstract: Decentralized energy transactions within untrusted and non-transparent energy markets in modern smart grids expose vulnerabilities and are susceptible to attacks. To address this threat, this paper proposes GridWatch, an effective real-time in-network intelligent framework to detect false data injection attacks.

### 2. **[E-commerce bot traffic: In-network impact, detection, and mitigation[ICIN2024]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10494459)**
   - Abstract: This explores a vulnerability of in-network caching to
bots traffic, showing it can significantly degrade performance. To mit-
igate the effect of bots traffic it introduces In-network Caching Shel-
ter (INCS), an in-network machine learning solution implemented on
NVIDIA BlueField-2 DPU. I contributed to conceive, design, and per-
form the experiments as well as analyzing the data, and writing the
paper.
